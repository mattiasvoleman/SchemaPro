-- Assumes `npm run db:seed` has already created the demo school. Adds a second
-- school, one user and a little of its own scheduling setup, so the policy
-- tests can prove a principal scoped to the first school cannot see the
-- second. Without rows over here, every isolation assertion would pass
-- vacuously — true of a table that simply has nothing in it.
--
-- Idempotent: safe to re-run.
