# SchemaPro — Deployment Runbook

Step-by-step guide for taking SchemaPro from this repository to a running
production pilot. Written for the reference stack: **Supabase** (Auth +
Postgres), the **NestJS API** and **Python solver** on a container host, and
the **Next.js web app** on Vercel or any Node host.

Estimated time for a first deployment: **half a day**, most of it in
verification (step 9).

> **New to this?** [`deployment-walkthrough.md`](deployment-walkthrough.md)
> covers the same deployment in plain language, with every click spelled out
> and a "check it worked" after each step. This runbook assumes you already
> know your way around Postgres, containers and DNS.

## 0. Prerequisites

- A Supabase project (Pro tier recommended for daily backups).
- A container host for the API + solver (Fly.io, Railway, Render, a VPS with
  Docker, …). Both are single containers; `docker-compose.yml` shows the
  wiring.
- A host for the web app (Vercel is the path of least resistance).
- Node.js 20+, Docker, and the Supabase dashboard open.

Generate two secrets now and keep them handy:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32   # AI_ENGINE_API_KEY (shared gateway ↔ solver secret)
```

The JWT secret is **not** generated — it comes from Supabase (step 1).

---

## 1. Configure the Supabase project

All in the Supabase dashboard:

1. **Collect credentials** (Settings → API):
   - Project URL → `SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - Publishable (anon) key → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` / `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - Service role key → `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (**server-only** — used
     exclusively by the API's user-invite flow)
   - JWT secret (Settings → API → JWT Settings) → `JWT_SECRET`
2. **Auth settings** (Authentication → URL Configuration):
   - Site URL: your web origin, e.g. `https://app.yourschool.example`
   - Redirect URLs: add `https://app.yourschool.example/**` (the invite and
     password-reset flows land on `/<locale>/update-password`)
3. **Email templates** (Authentication → Emails): review the *Invite user* and
   *Reset password* templates; the defaults work. For real deliverability,
   configure custom SMTP (Authentication → SMTP) — Supabase's built-in sender
   is rate-limited to a handful of emails per hour.
4. **Disable public signups** (Authentication → Providers → Email): turn off
   "Allow new users to sign up". All accounts are created by admin invitation
   through the API.

---

## 2. Apply database migrations

Migrations run as the database owner (the `postgres` user), using the
**direct** connection (port 5432), not the pooler.

```bash
# In the repo root — .env with the OWNER connection for this step:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:<DB_PASSWORD>@db.<ref>.supabase.co:5432/postgres"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres:<DB_PASSWORD>@db.<ref>.supabase.co:5432/postgres"

npm ci
npm run migrate:deploy    # tables, indexes, RLS, policies (both migrations)
npm run migrate:status    # verify: "Database schema is up to date!"
```

## 3. Create the API's least-privilege database role

The API must **never** connect as `postgres` (the owner bypasses RLS). Create
a login role that is a member of `authenticated` — run once in the Supabase
SQL editor:

```sql
create role app_authenticated login password '<STRONG_GENERATED_PASSWORD>'
  in role authenticated inherit;
```

The runtime connection string for the API (step 4) uses this role through the
**pooler** (port 6543):

```
postgresql://app_authenticated.<ref>:<PASSWORD>@aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1
```

> Sanity check: connect as `app_authenticated` and run
> `select count(*) from "Schools";` — it must return **0 rows visible** (RLS
> filters everything for a session with no JWT claims), not an error.

---

## 4. Deploy the AI engine (solver)

```bash
cd optimization-engine
docker build -t schemapro-solver .
```

Run it with:

| Env var | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `APP_ENV` | `production` |
| `API_KEY` | the generated `AI_ENGINE_API_KEY` |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | the API's origin, e.g. `https://api.yourschool.example` |
| `SOLVER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `60` (raise for very large schools) |

The solver needs no database and no PII ever reaches it. Keep it on a private
network reachable only by the API if your host supports it.

Verify: `curl https://<solver-host>/health` (or `/docs` for the OpenAPI UI).

## 5. Deploy the NestJS API

```bash
docker build -t schemapro-api .   # repo root
```

Run it with (see `.env.example` for the full annotated list):

| Env var | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |
| `PORT` | `4000` |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | web origin first (also used for invite links), e.g. `https://app.yourschool.example` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | the pooled `app_authenticated` string from step 3 |
| `DIRECT_URL` | same value (migrations are run separately, step 2) |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Supabase JWT secret |
| `JWT_ISSUER` | `https://<ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1` |
| `JWT_AUDIENCE` | `authenticated` |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | project URL |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | service role key |
| `AI_ENGINE_URL` | solver base URL |
| `AI_ENGINE_API_KEY` | the shared secret from step 0 |
| `AI_ENGINE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `90000` (must exceed the solver timeout) |
| `THROTTLE_TTL_SECONDS` / `THROTTLE_LIMIT` | `60` / `120` |

Verify: any request without a bearer token returns `401` in the RFC-7807
shape, e.g. `curl -i https://api.yourschool.example/api/v1/subjects -X POST`.

## 6. Deploy the web app

On Vercel: import the repo, set the **root directory to `web/`**, and add:

| Env var | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | publishable key |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` | the API origin, e.g. `https://api.yourschool.example` |

Verify: visiting `/` redirects to `/sv/login`; the language switcher flips to
English; `/sv/admin` redirects to login when signed out.

---

## 7. Bootstrap the first school and admin

There is intentionally no public signup. One-time, in the Supabase dashboard:

1. **Create the auth user**: Authentication → Users → *Add user* → email +
   temporary password (or *Send invitation*). Copy the user's **UUID**.
2. **Create the tenant and profile** (SQL editor, as owner):

```sql
insert into "Schools" (name, slug, timezone, "updatedAt")
values ('Demo School', 'demo-school', 'Europe/Stockholm', now());

insert into "Users" ("schoolId", "authId", role, "firstName", "lastName", email, "updatedAt")
values (
  (select id from "Schools" where slug = 'demo-school'),
  '<AUTH_USER_UUID>',
  'SCHOOL_ADMIN',
  'Anna', 'Andersson', '<same email as the auth user>',
  now()
);
```

`"updatedAt"` is mapped with Prisma's `@updatedAt`, which is maintained in the
application layer and creates **no database default** — every hand-written
`insert` against these tables must supply it, on all 12 models that carry it.
`"createdAt"` does default, so only `"updatedAt"` errors. Keep the double
quotes: unquoted, PostgreSQL folds the identifier to `updatedat`.

`"authId"` is the only link between the Supabase Auth user and this profile —
`JwtStrategy` resolves the account by it alone. A wrong UUID produces a
successful sign-in followed by *"No active user profile is linked to this
account."*

3. Sign in on the web app — you land on the admin dashboard. Every subsequent
   user is invited through **Admin → People** (the API sends the Supabase
   invite email automatically).

## 8. Mobile app (teacher attendance)

The mobile app is distributed as a build, not a deployment:

```bash
cd mobile
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
cp .env.example .env.local   # EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL, EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
                             # EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
npx expo start               # development on a device via Expo Go*
npx eas build --platform all # store/TestFlight builds via EAS
```

\* Note: `expo-secure-store` and biometrics require a development build
(`npx expo run:ios` / `run:android`) rather than Expo Go.

---

## 9. Post-deployment verification (do not skip)

Walk the full product loop once, in order:

1. **Auth**: sign in as the bootstrap admin; use *Forgot password* once to
   confirm email delivery and the `/update-password` redirect.
2. **Setup wizard** (`/admin/setup`): create an academic year (mark active),
   3+ subjects, 2+ rooms, 2+ groups.
3. **People** (`/admin/people`): invite one teacher and a few students
   (assign students to a group). Confirm the teacher receives the invite
   email and can set a password.
4. **Demand** (`/admin/requirements`): add requirements (e.g. each group ×
   each subject, 2 lessons/week) and assign the teacher.
5. **Constraints** (`/admin/constraints`): add one teacher-unavailable slot.
6. **Generate** (`/admin/generate`): run optimization; watch the job reach
   *SUCCEEDED* with a FEASIBLE/OPTIMAL solver status. Then temporarily make a
   teacher unavailable all week and re-run to confirm the **conflict report**
   renders; delete that constraint and generate again.
7. **Publish** (`/admin/timetable`): review per group/teacher, publish, and
   confirm `CalendarLessons` appear for the term.
8. **Teacher flow**: sign in as the teacher (web): weekly schedule shows;
   record attendance for today's lesson. On mobile: sign in, open the
   schedule tab, take attendance in airplane mode, re-enable network and
   confirm the queue syncs (banner returns to *Connected*, records appear in
   the web view).
9. **Student flow**: sign in as a student; verify they see **only** their own
   schedule and attendance.
10. **Automated suites**: `npm run test:e2e` (API), `npm run test:engine`
    (solver), and `cd web && npx playwright install chromium && npx
    playwright test` (web smoke) from any healthy machine or CI.

## 10. Operations

- **Backups**: enable Supabase PITR/daily backups. The database is the only
  stateful component — API, solver and web are stateless.
- **Logs**: the API logs are PII-free by design; ship container stdout to your
  log aggregator. Watch for `Optimization job failed` and Prisma connection
  errors.
- **Scaling**: one API container is fine for a school. Before running
  multiple instances, move throttling and the optimization job store to Redis
  (see improvements below).
- **Key rotation**: rotating the Supabase JWT secret invalidates all sessions
  and requires updating `JWT_SECRET` on the API at the same time. Rotate the
  service-role key freely (only the API uses it).

# Future improvements

Roughly ordered by expected value for a real school.

**Product**
1. ~~**Timetable adjustments**~~ — ✅ done: lessons on the master-timetable
   review page open an edit dialog (day/time/room/teacher) backed by
   `PATCH /api/v1/master-lessons/:id` with conflict validation; future
   published lessons without attendance move along automatically. A full
   drag-and-drop interaction remains a nice-to-have on top.
2. ~~**Real-time schedule updates**~~ — ✅ done: a Socket.IO gateway in
   NestJS (`src/realtime/`) authenticates via the Supabase JWT handshake and
   emits `calendar_lesson_updated` to school/user rooms; lesson cancel /
   reinstate / substitute actions broadcast automatically.
3. ~~**Substitute management**~~ — ✅ done: the admin **Day planner** page
   cancels/reinstates lessons and assigns substitutes per lesson via
   `PATCH /api/v1/calendar-lessons/:id/{cancel,reinstate,substitute}`.
4. **Holiday calendar** — a first-class school-holidays entity instead of the
   current mechanism (full-day group `UNAVAILABLE` constraints), plus term
   date ranges when publishing.
5. **Reports & exports** — ✅ partially done: the admin **Reports** page shows
   attendance rates per class/student for a period with CSV export. Still
   open: printable timetables (PDF) and school-wide trend reports.
6. **Notifications** — email/push for schedule changes, unrecorded
   attendance, and repeated student absences (guardian notifications).
7. **Guardian role** — parents viewing their child's schedule and attendance;
   requires a guardianship relation and new RLS policies.
8. **SIS import** — CSV/Excel import for students, teachers and groups so
   onboarding doesn't require manual entry.
9. **Incremental re-optimization** — re-solve with the existing timetable as
   a warm start and "minimal changes" as an objective, instead of full
   regeneration.
10. **More locales** — the i18n plumbing supports it; each language is one
    message catalog in `web/messages/`.

**Engineering**
11. ~~**CI pipeline**~~ — ✅ done: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs API
    typecheck + e2e, web typecheck + build, solver pytest and mobile
    typecheck on every push/PR.
12. **Durable job queue** — move optimization jobs from the in-memory map to
    Redis/BullMQ or a `OptimizationJobs` table; prerequisite for horizontal
    scaling and job history.
13. **Redis-backed throttling** — the ThrottlerModule is already wired for
    it (`REDIS_URL`), just needs the storage package enabled.
14. **Seeded staging environment** — ✅ partially done: `npm run db:seed`
    creates a demo school (subjects, rooms, classes, 8 teachers, 80 students,
    full curriculum) via `prisma/seed.ts`; run with owner credentials
    (`DIRECT_URL`). Still open: authenticated Playwright tests on top of it.
15. **Audit log** — append-only record of admin mutations (who changed what,
    when) — often a procurement requirement for schools.
16. **Observability** — OpenTelemetry traces across web → API → solver,
    plus solver run metrics (solve time, conflict counts).
17. **Asymmetric JWT verification** — switch from the shared HS256 secret to
    Supabase's JWKS (RS256/ES256) so the API holds no signing secret.
18. **Mobile hardening** — retire the legacy `secureTokenStore` profile cache
    in favor of the Supabase session as the single source of truth, add
    certificate pinning, and add Detox tests for the offline queue.
