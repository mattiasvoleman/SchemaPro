/**
 * Global PrismaService with RLS-aware transaction helper.
 *
 * ## Security design
 *
 * The PostgreSQL RLS policies evaluate `auth.uid()` and `auth.role()`, which
 * read from:
 *   - `current_setting('request.jwt.claim.sub', true)`  — subject / authId
 *   - `current_setting('request.jwt.claim.role', true)` — role string
 *
 * (The migration also accepts the full JSON blob via `request.jwt.claims`,
 * but injecting individual claims is cheaper and avoids any JSON parsing
 * inside every policy evaluation.)
 *
 * `withRls()` opens a serializable-isolated transaction, sets those session
 * variables with `SET LOCAL` (scoped to the transaction, not the connection),
 * runs the caller-supplied queries, then commits. This guarantees:
 *   1. Every single application query goes through RLS, because the connection
 *      role is `app_authenticated` (a non-owner) — set via `DATABASE_URL`.
 *   2. The session variables are never visible across requests even when the
 *      same pooled connection is reused (SET LOCAL is transaction-scoped).
 *   3. No PII or JWT claims are written to application logs; only the
 *      anonymous traceId / request path are logged by the exception filter.
